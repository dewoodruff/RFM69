DEPRECATED - should not be used.

This modification integrated session key support directly into the base RFM69 library created by Felix Rusu (felix@lowpowerlab.com). After discussion on the lowpowerlab forum here: https://lowpowerlab.com/forum/index.php/topic,878.0.html and here: https://lowpowerlab.com/forum/index.php/topic,966.0.html session key support has been added as an extension using TomWS's virtualization modification to the base RFM69 library.
